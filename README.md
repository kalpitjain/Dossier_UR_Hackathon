# Dossier

Dossier is a Decentralised Public Blogging Website built on the Internet Computer Protocol ( ICP ) using React as a front-end framework and Motoko to build the back-end. With Dossier, blogging will be accessible to all. The user owns their blogs and can decide whether to keep or delete them as long as they are under guidelines. Dossier Finance's DOSS tokens are required to create blogs on Dossier. Dossier Finance has a Faucet through which you can get DOSS tokens for testing Dossier and giving feedback. With the Check Balance Block, you can check the number of funds in an account, and with the Transfer Block, you can transfer funds from one account to another. We also have a Dossier Account page where you can see your account details and all the activity log of the account. Dossier stores all data without a centralized database using ICP canisters. Users are authenticated using Internet Identity as part of its security measures to prevent misuse of Dossier's website.
